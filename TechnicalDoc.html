      <p>C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.

      <header>FEATURES</header>
       <p>The main features of c language includes:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>General Purpose and Portable</li>
          <li>Low-level Memory Access</li>
          <li>Fast speed</li>
          <li>Clean syntax</li>
       </ul>
      <p>These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="WHY_SHOULD_WE_LEARN_C?">
      <header>WHY_SHOULD_WE_LEARN_C?</header>
      <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. </p><p>Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>
      <p>So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.</p>

      <header>STRUCTURE_OF_C</header>
       <p>we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error. The structure of a C program is as follows:</p>
       <br>
       <code><p class="structure">header<br>function declaration<br>main function<br>{<br>declaration statements;<br>excutive statements;<br>return;<br>}<br></p></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="HELLO_WORLD">
      <header>HELLO_WORLD</header>
       <p>Here is the sample program for c (hello world program)</p>
      <code><div> #include<
      stdio.h
      ><br>int main()<br>{<br>printf("Hello world");<br>return 0;<br>}<br></div></code>
      <code><p>output: Hello world</p></code>

      <header>APPLICATIONS_OF_C</header>
        <p>c programming language uses in different situations. Here are the some of the applications of c</p>
       <ul>
         <li><code>Operating systems</code>: C is widely used for developing operating systems such as Unix, Linux, and Windows.</li>
         <li><code>Embedded systems</code>: C is a popular language for developing embedded systems such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, and other electronic devices.</li>
         <li><code>System software</code>: C is used for developing system software such as device drivers, compilers, and assemblers.</li>
         <li><code>Networking</code>: C is widely used for developing networking applications such as web servers, network protocols, and network drivers.</li>
         <li><code>Database systems</code>: C is used for developing database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.</li>
         <li><code>Artificial Intelligence</code>: C is used for developing artificial intelligence and machine learning applications such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms.</li>
         <li><code>Scientific applications</code>: C is used for developing scientific applications such as simulation software and numerical analysis tools.</li>
         <li><code>Financial applications</code>: C is used for developing financial applications such as stock market analysis and trading systems.</li>
       </ul>
