      <ul>
         <li><strong>Born :</strong> March 25,1914 Saude, Iowa, United States</li><br>
         <li><strong>Family : </strong>Borlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889–1971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888–1972) on his grandparents' farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916–2004), Charlotte (Culbert; 1919–2012) and Helen (b. d. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the 106-acre (43 ha) family farm west of Protivin, fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, timothy-grass, cattle, pigs and chickens.</li><br>
         <li><strong>Education : </strong>After completing his primary and secondary education in Cresco, Borlaug enrolled in the University of Minnesota where he studied forestry. Immediately before and immediately after receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937, he worked for the U.S. Forestry Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. Returning to the University of Minnesota to study plant pathology, he received the master’s degree in 1939 and the doctorate in 1942.</li><br>
         <li><strong>Contribution to agriculture : </strong>Dr. Borlaug developed successive generations of wheat varieties with broad and stable disease resistance, broad adaptation to growing conditions across many degrees of latitude, and with exceedingly high yield potential. These new wheat varieties and improved crop management practices transformed agricultural production in Mexico during the 1940's and 1950's and later in Asia and Latin America, sparking what today is known as the "Green Revolution." Because of his achievements to prevent hunger, famine and misery around the world, it is said that Dr. Borlaug has "saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived."</li><br>
         <li><strong>Green Revolution : </strong>Norman Borlaug is the father of the green revolution. He worked to create a dwarf variety of wheat at the International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement in Mexico. These dwarf spring wheat strains had high yielding capacities, the seeds of which were used in India.</li><br>
